if (13 == "space") {

// What will console log display ? 

// Nothing because there will be the following errors: 
// 1. 13 == "space" will produce an error => so cowsound won't ge any value.
// 2.cowsound is undefined as its scope is limited to if.

// 13  ? belongs to Local Scope
// cowsound belongs to the Local Scope


// Will there be an error?
// Why?
// Will something be undefined?
// Why?
// To what scope does each variable belong?
// Global or local? If local, to which specifically?
